# movie_trailer_website
This project is been accomplished for educational purposes for the Udacity's **Full Stack Developer Nanodegree** [here](https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd004)


##Using the app
You can run this app my executing the command in the command prompt as 
``` python ./entertainment_center.py ```

Or Click [Here](venky343.github.io/movie_trailer_website)

This will redirect you to an ```.html``` file called the ```fresh_tomatoes.html```, where some of my favorite movies are displayed with their name, poster and the trailer for that particular movie can be accessed by a click on the movie you would like to watch.

##Table of Contents
* entertainment_center.py
* fresh_tomatoes.html
* fresh_tomatoes.py
* media.py

##Complications
Feel free to add more movies to the ```entertainment_center.py``` script.

One complication you would get is when you try to show up a movie poster use imdb website posters as they do not have any permissions and are been used for educational purposes only.
    Using wikipedia posters might not load up the posters in the website as they have permissions to restrict from third-party usage.

##Credits
Thanks to Udacity for lending us use their python script ```fresh_tomatoes.py```
